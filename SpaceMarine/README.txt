Game Features:
I coded a bunch of features in, I'll list them below.

- Shooting in any direction using the mouse
- Various Animations for player and enemies
- Sound and music
- Multiple Weapons
- Visualisation of weapon changes 
- Health and Armor system and their accompanying bars
- Game over (losing condition)
- Different types of enemies with individual speeds and health
- Killing Enemies 
- Random spawning of enemies upon death
- A decently designed stage [ in my opinion at least :) ]


The three largest/main features would have to be The shooting mechanic, 
changing weapons and the general asthetics (animations, displays, stage, etc)

I abandoned the grid system, I didn't read the assignment question properly and its 3AM  right now
and I'm just not gonna do it. I Suppose I'll have to get 0/10 for that part.

Basic A.I is used here, enemies follow the player and when they collide with the player,
damage is done and the player loses health. If the player runs out of health, the game ends.

There is no winning state, the player endlessley kills enemies until a game over (you die)

I didn't have time to complete everything I had wanted too so forgive me if there are pieces of code
that seem out of place or redundant.

A couple of minor errors:
Just thought id point put a couple of errors that I didn't have the time to fix.

- An animation plays when a bullet disapears but the animation itself doesnt dissapear.
- A sound error for shooting, if you shoot really fast the sound will stop playing.
  it was either that, or playing the sound everytime the mouse was clicked. I chose the former.
- Enemies always face the same way as the player (animation wise)
- Enemies dont collide with eachother or the environment (results in them grouping pretty tightely) 
- The shooting mechanic gets a little wonky in certain areas of the map (have no idea why)

Thats all I have to declare. Enjoy marking :)
